One of the guiding principals of the book was to have a mantra that could ground us throughout the potential craziness of wedding planning.  Our mantra: LOVE. \n This mantra supported our choice to have our special day at a location where our most special people can spend time together – connect with close friends and family, reconnect with old ones, and make new ones.  We also acknowledge that this takes extra effort, time and funds on your part…so once you make it, we want to make sure you feel taken care of and have plenty to do (or not do).",
