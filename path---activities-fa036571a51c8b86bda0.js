One of the guiding principals of the book was to have a mantra that could ground us throughout the potential craziness of wedding planning.  Our mantra: __LOVE__.\n\nThis mantra supported our choice to have our special day at a location where our most special people can spend time together – connect with close friends and family, reconnect with old ones, and make new ones.  We also acknowledge that this takes extra effort, time and funds on your part… so once you make it, we want to make sure you feel taken care of and have plenty to do (or not do, if that's your thing).",subSections:[{title:"go play",subtitle:"hikes, golf, and more",imageUrl:"images/wedding-us.jpg",id:"play",blurb:"Suncadia is the epitome of what’s best about the Pacific Northwest (Washington is Carolyn’s home state). It also offers the hiking, fishing, biking, golfing, walking trails (and wine!) that are some of Jonathan’s favorite things. Together, we love to go on long walks to connect – and virtually everything is walk-able around Suncadia.\n\n### Walking & Running Trails\nOne of our favorite weekend activities is an “urban hike” where we explore new and unexpected parts of San Francisco. While we won’t be in the city, we love the opportunity to get lost in all of the [walking, running & biking trails throughout Suncadia](https://www.destinationhotels.com/suncadia-resort/activities/washington-family-vacation).\nYou may spot Carolyn running through the trails the morning of our wedding day.\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azoff/wedding/master/src/images/Caro_Jon_Hike.jpg)"},{title:"eat, drink",subtitle:"and be married",imageUrl:"images/Cheers_J&C.png",id:"dine",blurb:"[Swiftwater Cellars](https://www.swiftwatercellars.com/): Grab a beer or glass of wine on the outdoor patio.

But there is something we both love about bonfires and golden brown 'mallows. Look out for bonfires throughout the resort – near the Amphitheater, The Inn, and The Lodge."}]}},pathContext:{id:"activities"}}}});
